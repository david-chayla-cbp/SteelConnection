Tutorial
========

Let's start by creating a SteelConnection object.

1. Use the ``steelconnection.SConnect`` constructor to create the object.
2. We will assign this new object to the name ``sc``.
3. We will provide the name of our realm, as well as the username and
   password we use to login.

.. code:: python

   import steelconnection
   sc = steelconnection.SConnect('myrealm.riverbed.cc', 'admin', 'LetM3in')
