Test against various versions that may have issues with requests / SSL:
    and may require urllib3 disable warnings.

Write tests using pytest.

Needs to be [friendlier, more explicit, more helpful] when errors occur.

Re-visit error handling - forced exceptions on non-200 return codes.

Don't restrict scm name to somthing.cc ...
validate by resolving name/ip, 
or by creating a connection on instantiation.
- in the latter case, perhaps explicit errors letting user knwo what went wrong.

docstrings - need to be expanded for better documentation.

logging!

better way to store authentication:  Keyring Support??
how could I take advantage of .netns support in requests?
should instantiation generate a call to scm 'status' to test auth?
-- does 'status' work if user is only org admin?

need to handle binary return - like download vGW image.zip
- GET /node/:nodeid/get_image
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#binary-response-content
with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)

http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#raw-response-content

with open(filename, 'wb') as fd:
    for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=128):
        fd.write(chunk)
